There are also special event spaces. If a player land on a special event space they must draw a card from the correspondingly colored card deck, the four ages mentioned at the beginning. This is why the paths must be color tagged even though they are transparent, a player can only be allowed to pick a card from the deck matching the color of the age they are in/path they are on. All these points are transparent. The special event spaces are as follows:

Setup
Choose a Role:
Revolutionary: 14 Knowledge, 8 Influence (Opposes Colonialist)
Historian: 14 Knowledge, 8 Money (Opposes Politician)
Colonialist: 14 Money, 8 Influence (Opposes Revolutionary)
Entrepreneur: 14 Money, 8 Knowledge (Opposes Artist)

Shuffle Cards. There are 4 different event cards matching the colors of the paths on the board. Place the cards in the color coded boxes that match the colors of the cards. Place the End Of Turn cards in either or both of the end of turn boxes.
Decide First Player: Roll a die.

Gameplay
Each turn, a player:
Rolls a standard 6 sided dice and moves
Lands on a game space:
Regular Spaces: No effect.  
Event Spaces: Draws a Special Event Space Card.
Draws an End of Turn Card (mandatory).
Resolves effects based on their role.
Ends turn.
Strategic Mechanics
These are all entirely dictated by the special event cards. Some of the cards may allow players for trade resources, form temporary alliances, steal resources, etc. Alliances: Temporary partnerships to share or mitigate losses/gains.
Players may switch paths whenever they pass a multi-directional space, the coordinates of which were already noted above. 
Cards must always be returned to the bottom of the respective deck before the next player's turn starts unless it is an alliance card or a trade card. Sabotage cards must be used that turn 
Victory Conditions
The game ends when after all players reach the finish square. Some players may take more turns than others to finish depending on their paths and cards so the game may go one even after another player or all other players have crossed the finish line.
The player with the highest combined total of Money, Knowledge, and Influence wins.
Players with zero in any category are eliminated.
Computer players should not have AI. Their behavior should be dictated by the cards they get, they will not change paths, land on no more then 2 special event spaces and always agree to anything offered them by a human player be it an alliance, a trade, a sabotage or anything else. 
All End of turn cards can be found at \board game\assets\cards\endofturncards.json
All Special event cards can be found separated by their name and color at \board game\assets\cards\specialeventcards.json
Listeners will have to be set up  for dice rolls, space clicks, direction change clicks, resource management, other.  The board image in located at \board game\board.png
